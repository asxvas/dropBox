# DropBoxes

This is a simple yet effective drop box solution, you can customize almost anything using this!

If you want to use this please DM me on Discord, my Discord is (asxv)


## Usage 
- Simply download and upload the **main.sk** file. Please ensure to fill out all the options from **Line 7** to **Line 31**
### Commands
- **/testdrop** - This just starts a dropbox event
## How does it actually work?
- After every so long (Configurable) a dropbox is spawned in the air and falls down at a speed of 4 blocks per second. Once the box falls down players are able to open the box. After configured despawn time. The box is despawned along with all items in it.
## Implementation
- If you are looking to use timers and coordinates of the drop box I have created a somewhat ease to use system for this, I have left some examples below of how to implement the timers and the location in the [Location] and the [Timers] files.
